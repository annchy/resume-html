    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I am a third year undergraduate student of Computer Science developing and making full cycle projects with experience
        in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Web Developer. Hopes to focus more on
        Machine Learning and Web Development in the future career. A beginner in open-sourcing but slowly and
        steadily finding my way to contribute to society more.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <li>
        <strong>Driver Drowsiness Detection</strong>
        <p><em>The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents a
                system is
                build using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will detect if the driver is sleepy.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Skin Cancer detection using Skin lesion image dataset</strong>
        <p><em>A machine learning technique was trained on a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of
                pigmented lesions. It helps in the classification of how likely different skin-conditions are of having skin
                cancer.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cyclone Detection</strong>
        <p><em>Tropical Coastal areas in the part of Odisha, India suffers cyclones and associated storm regularly and thus
                do a lot of damage, therefore with the help of this model we can easily predict cyclone.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Accident Detection From CCTV Footage</strong>
        <p><em>The datasets contains frames captured from YouTube Videos involving accidents. Implementing an CNN
                architecture to capture the features and predict if the images fall under Accident classification or Nonaccidental
                classification.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Face Emoji</strong>
        <p><em>Model that will extract the faces from data in it's normalized way,via Open-CV and Computer Vision and will
                swap the faces with emoticon.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Image based Pothole Detection for Intelligent and smoother Driving</strong>
        <p><em>Every year a lot of cars bear a heft damage because of the potholes in the road. this model prediction the
                Potholes with the help of the camera in real time and thus can warn the driver regarding the same.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prediction of the Heart Attack</strong>
        <p><em>This model helps to classify whether a person with certain features and attribute might suffer from Heart-
                Attack or not.
                The attributes may range from age, sex, chest pain type (4 values) to the slope of the peak exercise ST
                segment and number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Face mask Detection</strong>
        <p><em>The machine learning classification model was trained on a large image dateset to classify an image of a
                face with or without mask.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Solving CAPTCHA OCR</strong>
        <p><em>This model will read the CAPTCHA image and will generate an outcome that will tell the characters and
                numbers written in that image. Thus here AI is used to break the captcha problem.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Instagram account spam classifier</strong>
        <p><em>Instagram consist of Millions of account with some being real and some being spam (fake/bot accounts). The
                Algorithm used in this model will be able to predict whether the given account with it's username, followers,
                follows, and some other details is classified as spam or genuine account.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Predicting and Plotting Google Stock Price using LSTM</strong>
        <p><em>Though Stock prices are called independent of their past, but they always form a pattern which might be
                helpful to many investors to know when and where to invest.
                This model helps in prediction of the stock prices using LSTM (Long - Short Term Memory). The visualization
                is also done to compare the original and the predicted trend in Stocks prices.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Working Website for a construction company</strong>
        <p><em>With the help of boostrap and tailwind created a website for a construction company (Dev. enterprises). visit <a href="https://devent.netlify.app/">here</a></em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Zcanner</strong>
        <p><em>A complete python script that will take an image as an input and will return and save the scanned result of
                that document/image.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Face-detection using SSD</strong>
        <p><em>This project can detect face with high confidence and the help of a pre-trained Caffe and SSF (single shot
                detector) model on an image or a webcam.</em></p>
